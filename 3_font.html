         <p>Jallikattu (or sallikkattu), also known as eru thazhuvuthal and ma√±cuvirattu[2], is a traditional event in which a bull (Bos indicus), 
           such as the Pulikulam[3] or Kangayam breeds,[4] is released into a crowd of people, 
           and multiple human participants attempt to grab the large hump on the bull's back with both arms and hang on to it while the bull attempts to escape.
           Participants hold the hump for as long as possible, attempting to bring the bull to a stop.</p>
