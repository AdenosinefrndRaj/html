<!--HTML tables allow web developers to arrange data into rows and columns.
Define an HTML Table

A table in HTML consists of table cells inside rows and columns
Table Cells

Each table cell is defined by a <td> and a </td> tag.

td stands for table data.

Everything between <td> and </td> are the content of the table cell.
table data elements are the data containers of the table.
They can contain all sorts of HTML elements; text, images, lists, other tables, etc.

Each table row starts with a <tr> and end with a </tr> tag.

tr stands for table row.

You can have as many rows as you like in a table, just make sure that the number of cells are the same in each row.

Note: There are times where a row can have less or more cells than another. You will learn about that in a later chapter.
Table Headers

Sometimes you want your cells to be headers, in those cases use the <th> tag instead of the <td> tag:

    By default, the text in <th> elements are bold and centered, but you can change that with CSS. -->
